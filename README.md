The MAFOR (Multicomponent Aerosol FORmation) model is a Lagrangian type sectional aerosol box model which includes gas phase and aqueous phase chemistry in addition to aerosol dynamics. MAFOR consistently solves the time evolution of the particle number and mass concentration distribution of a multicomponent aerosol using the fixed sectional method and simultaneously the time-dependent concentrations of chemical compounds in the gas phase and also in the aqueous phase of supermicron droplets.

MAFOR v2 is a community model for aerosol dynamics. All code is written in Fortran.

The software program is a console application with no GUI at the moment. The main intention of distributing the MAFOR model is the usage for educational and research purposes. We are looking for interested developers who want to contribute to the further development of MAFOR.

Model users preparing publications resulting from the usage of MAFOR are requested to cite:
