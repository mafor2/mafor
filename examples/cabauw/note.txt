For the ICONW1 run, water condensation is set to 1.
For the ICONW2 run, water condensation is set to 2.

The Kelvin effect option is set to 0.
Nucleation is turned off in both simulations. 
Condensation of sulphate, organics and ammonium is on. 
The switch for chemistry integration is set to 1. 

The results from the two runs have to be saved to different 
sub-folders (named iconw1 and iconw2) of the output folder.

Changes of the scenario compared to versin 1.9:

sensitiv.dat
============
ICONW1 and ICONW2 both with Ke=0

inchem.dat
==========
increased init KPP_NH3   from 2.0E10 to 1.0E11

  reduced init KPP_HNO3  from 5.0E10 to 1.0E10

reduced   emis KPP_NO2   from 5.0E12 to 5.0E10

increased emis KPP_NH3   from 4.0E10 to 5.0E10
