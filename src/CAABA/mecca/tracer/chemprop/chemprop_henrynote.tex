\item {\bf  HNO3:} Calculated using the acidity constant from \citet  {450}.
\item {\bf  CH3O2:} This value was estimated by \citet  {46}.
\item {\bf  C2H5O2:} Assumed to be the same as for CH3O2.
\item {\bf  HBr:} Calculated using the acidity constant from \citet  {194}.
\item {\bf  HOBr:} Twice the value of HOCl, according to \citet  {288}. Same temperature dependence as for HOCl assumed.
\item {\bf  IO:} Assumed to be the same as for HOI.
\item {\bf  HOI:} Lower limit.
\item {\bf  ICl:} Calculated using thermodynamic data from \citet  {489}.
\item {\bf  IBr:} Calculated using thermodynamic data from \citet  {489}.
\item {\bf  H2SO4:} To account for the very high Henry's law coefficient of H2SO4, a very high value was chosen arbitrarily.
\item {\bf  DMSO:} Lower limit cited from another reference.
\item {\bf  HgCl:} Assumed to be the same as for HgCl2.
\item {\bf  HgBr:} Assumed to be the same as for HgCl2.
\item {\bf  HgBr2:} Assumed to be the same as for HgCl2.
\item {\bf  ClHgBr:} Assumed to be the same as for HgCl2.
\item {\bf  BrHgOBr:} Assumed to be the same as for HgCl2.
\item {\bf  ClHgOBr:} Assumed to be the same as for HgCl2.
