\note{A6102_a01}{\citet{1008} found an upper limit of \code{6E9} and cite an upper limit from another study of \code{2E9}. Here, we set the rate coefficient to \code{1E9}.}

\note{A6301_a01}{There is also an earlier study by \citet{69} which found a smaller rate coefficient but did not consider the back reaction.}

\note{A9105_a01}{The rate coefficient for the sum of the paths (leading to either \chem{HSO_5^-} or \chem{SO_4^{2-}}) is from \citet{75}, the ratio 0.28/0.72 is from \citet{111}.}

\note{A9106_a01}{See also: \citep{75,1}. If this reaction produces a lot of \chem{SO_4^-}, it will have an effect. However, we currently assume only the stable \chem{S_2O_8^{2-}} as product. Since \chem{S_2O_8^{2-}} is not treated explicitly in the mechanism, \chem{SO_4^{2-}} is used as a proxy and the second sulfur atom is put into the lumped LSULFUR.}
